/**
 * Playwright config for the starter's E2E auth smoke suite.
 *
 * Specs live in tests/e2e/. The webServer block spawns `pnpm dev` on
 * :3000 and waits for it to come up; in CI it's a fresh server per job,
 * locally it reuses an already-running dev server if one is up.
 *
 * Email delivery during E2E uses the dev-only 'file' provider from
 * lib/email.ts (see EMAIL_PROVIDER + EMAIL_OUTBOX_PATH below). The
 * specs read /tmp/auth-test-emails.jsonl to capture reset links.
 *
 * Tagged-suite convention: the starter's E2E specs carry an `@smoke`
 * tag in their describe/test titles. Playwright doesn't have
 * first-class tag filtering, but CI can use `--grep @smoke` (or set a
 * `grep` here) to
 * filter when a later Story adds non-smoke specs.
 *
 * Workers are pinned to 1 because both specs touch the same auth tables
 * and `truncateAuthTables()` is global — parallel workers would race.
